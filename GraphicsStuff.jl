#= I'm pretty sure this is in no way how multiple dispatch is meant to be used. I'm fully aware that this is going to
be unreadable and I'll forget these different versions of the method in a day but I want to start using it to learn
and this is a good opportunity to do it badly so I can do it better next time. =#
# Also probably worth looking at passing the towns themselves as opposed to indices and having to pass all of townList at the same time

# I think it would be good to refactor this. Switch it to store a list of

# one y to deal with, that can be plugged straight in to show the whole system without looping though traders
