    #= What. The. Fuck. Is. happening. I can't see any reason for the townHistory bit to assign to both
    population histories at all, let alone when it isn't doing that for the test. The test vector set up 
    should be identical to the storage and it's still happening so I really don't have a clue. My best
    bet is to start printing types of everything, start with the overall vectors and matrices and work
    inwards, and see if there's any way that the stoage and test objects are different. After that you pray
    and hope that wiping the kernel fixed it (yep, we're resorting to a nonexistent kernal being wiped).
